# Full-Stack AI Business Website & Secure Cloud Architecture

This repository contains the frontend and backend proxy for a complete, full-stack, AI-powered web application. The project was conceived and built as a comprehensive portfolio piece to demonstrate professional competency in modern cloud architecture, full-stack development, AI integration, and security best practices on Microsoft Azure.

The live application provides a seamless user experience with two core features unified through a single chat interface:
1.  **AI-Powered Conversational Q&A** on business topics.
2.  **Live, Typo-Tolerant Order Status Lookups** against a secure database.

## Architecture Diagram

The application is built with a modern, decoupled, and secure architecture. A static frontend communicates with a custom Python backend that acts as a **secure proxy**. This proxy intelligently routes requests to the appropriate Azure service, ensuring that no sensitive credentials or complex logic are ever exposed to the client-side.

### Data Flow

1.  **User Interaction:** A user interacts with the static frontend hosted on **Azure Static Web Apps**.
2.  **Secure API Call:** All requests are sent to a single **Backend Proxy** (Python/FastAPI) running in a Docker container on **Azure App Service**.
3.  **Intelligent Routing:** The proxy analyzes the request:
    *   For an order status lookup, it calls a dedicated, serverless microservice.
    *   For a general chat message, it securely authenticates to the **Azure AI Agent** using a Managed Identity.
4.  **Tool Execution:** The AI Agent uses a **Serverless Tool** (an **Azure Function**) to perform the actual database query. This function connects to **Azure SQL** using its own Managed Identity.
5.  **Response:** The result flows back through the chain to the user.

## Key Features & Technical Highlights

This project demonstrates a range of professional engineering practices:

### 1. Security-First Architecture
-   **Backend for Frontend (BFF) Pattern:** The FastAPI backend acts as a secure proxy, abstracting all complexity and credentials away from the client. The frontend has zero knowledge of API keys or other services.
-   **Passwordless Cloud Infrastructure:** All service-to-service communication within Azure is authenticated using **Azure AD Managed Identities**. This modern, best-practice approach eliminates all stored secrets like passwords or API keys from the application code and configuration.
-   **API Abuse Protection:** The backend API implements **rate limiting** to prevent spam and denial-of-service attacks from a single client.
-   **Hardened Endpoints:** The system uses a strict Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy, and underlying microservices are protected with function-level API keys.

### 2. Full-Stack Proficiency
-   **Frontend:** A clean, responsive UI built with **vanilla JavaScript**, demonstrating mastery of `async/await`, the `fetch` API, and secure DOM manipulation (`.innerText`).
-   **Backend:** A robust, asynchronous API built with **FastAPI** and **Pydantic** for automatic data validation.
-   **Containerization:** The backend is fully containerized with **Docker**, ensuring consistency between local development and cloud deployment on Azure App Service.

### 3. Advanced AI & Microservice Integration
-   **AI Orchestration:** An **Azure AI Agent** (`gpt-4o-mini`) manages the conversational flow, leverages a knowledge base, and uses custom tools to perform actions.
-   **Prompt Engineering:** A detailed system prompt directs the AI's behavior, personality, and response format, including rules for data privacy and handling out-of-scope questions.
-   **Decoupled Microservice:** A dedicated **Azure Function** acts as a serverless tool, isolating the typo-tolerant database query logic into its own scalable, efficient component.
    -   **[View the code for this microservice in its separate repository.](https://github.com/dawsonsallee/sallee-agent-tools)**

## Project Evolution & Key Learnings

This project's final architecture is the result of a realistic and challenging development process that required overcoming several real-world cloud issues. This journey demonstrates advanced debugging and problem-solving skills:

-   **The Agent Endpoint Pivot:** The initial plan to call the AI Agent directly from the frontend was blocked by platform limitations. **Solution:** Pivoted the architecture to create the secure backend proxy, a more robust and professional pattern.
-   **The Silent Deployment & Data Corruption Bug:** Diagnosed a multi-layered bug where an Azure Function was failing to update and sending corrupted data. **Solution:** Implemented defensive programming in the backend proxy to clean the data, making the system resilient to failures in its upstream microservices.
-   **The IAM & Security Hardening Cascade:** A full security audit (implementing firewalls and Managed Identities) triggered a complex chain of `403 Forbidden` errors. **Solution:** Methodically diagnosed the root cause by analyzing cloud-native logs, identifying a missing `Storage Table Data Contributor` IAM role required by the Azure Functions runtimeâ€”a deep, non-obvious infrastructure issue.
